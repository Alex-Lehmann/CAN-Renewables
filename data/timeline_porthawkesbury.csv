2009,Renewable energy target goals are set after concerns of whether it was really environmentally viable,"The Times Moncton, N.B..

2010,Proposals were submitted to spend $200 million on a renewable biomass energy project. Nova Scotia Power applied to build the Port Hawkesbury power plant. The propositions were issued and reviewed by the Nova Scotia Utility Review Board.,Telegraph-Journal. (2010). <i>Nova Scotia biomass project hearings on hold pending review of alternatives</i>.

2010,The Nova Scotia Power proposal won the bid for a biomass power plant construction in Port Hawkesbury for $208 million. Nova Scotia Power won the bid because it was seen as the best likelihood of reaching the renewable energy standard of 25% of the province’s energy to come from renewable resources by 2015 which was set by the province officials.,The Canadian Press.

2010,"Nova Scotia’s biomass energy policies and ecological practices were being reviewed by the Natural Resources Strategy members: Constance Glube, Joe Marshall, and Allan Shaw because it was warned that the forestry industry and resources in Nova Scotia were finite and local biomass sources would not be able to support the growing and dependent industry. Concerns were growing for the protection of the forests. While there were concerns about the forests, nothing came of these talks and the construction remained approved.","The Times Moncton, N.B..

2011,"The construction of Port Hawkesbury biomass power plant began. There were intentions to burn 650,000 tons of biomass a year. Biomass is requested and supplied by sources around the province and by the Nova Scotia Northern Pulp Mill. The Port Hawkesbury power plant wants sources of biomass to be from wood or sawdust, agricultural waste or organic material.",Pulp & Paper Canada.

2012,"Nova Scotia Power, in association with the government, has increased its rates on electricity utilities, making them much higher than in other provinces, despite having biomass as an energy source. This increase was met with significant backlash and criticism during December 2012 by the locals as prices have increased by 25% in the last 3 years and are projected to keep increasing in prices.","Nelson, S.

2012,"Nova Scotia Power was accused of being a monopoly within the province and faced even more criticism with protests around the power plant. It was called a monopoly because the government allowed Emera, the owners of Nova Scotia Power to buy a 30 MW biomass power plant called “Brooklyn Energy” instead of accepting bids like in 2009. The opposition to the local government in 2012 thought it was malpractice to not accept bids and led to dissatisfaction.","Nelson, S.

2016,"The Nova Scotia Power company found that burning wood chips and organic material cost more than burning fossil fuels like coal and natural gas did, so they wanted to run the Port Hawkesbury plant on an as-needed basis. However, a provincial law stated that the biomass plant legally must run 24/7.","Laroche, J. (2016). <i>Nova Scotia Power biomass plant will no longer run 24/7</i>.

2020,"CBC publishes an article citing an MIT professor that Nova Scotia’s biomass-burning electricity industry is going to speed up climate change, not contribute to mitigating it. The article cited citizens’ concerns and the fact that the forests that are cut down for obtaining the biomass are not being replanted on a large enough scale so they can regrow, and it is an unsustainable endeavor. The article and study exposed the way the industry is exhausting the natural material and not replenishing it over time.","Smith, E.
